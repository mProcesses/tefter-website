  main_heading: "Run Operations. Exchange Data Automatically. Keep Business Moving."
  main_subheading: "Tefter combines a resilient exchange layer with operational modules for sales, procurement, warehouse, partner management, and shipping optimization — so companies can manage orders, invoices, and deliveries while connecting seamlessly to ERPs, partners, and government systems, even when data is wrong or systems fail."
  
  new_category_title: "A New Category: Business Operations Integration"
  new_category_desc: "Traditional EDI connects systems. Traditional ERP runs business processes. Tefter bridges both worlds — it's a platform that operates your business AND ensures data flows reliably across your entire ecosystem, even when partners change formats, networks fail, or data doesn't match."
  
  problem_title: "The Problem We Solve"
  problem_intro: "Most companies connect partners using one of these familiar approaches — each with serious drawbacks:"
  
  path_erp_title: "The ERP-Centric Path"
  path_erp_desc: "Rely on your ERP for both operations and partner connections."
  path_erp_reality: "Complex and expensive, requires IT for every partner change, onboarding becomes a project (weeks, not hours), rigid requirements, and manual/opaque recovery when exchange fails."
  
  path_edi_title: "The EDI Service Path"
  path_edi_desc: "Purchase an EDI/integration service to connect partners while using separate systems for operations."
  path_edi_reality: "Moves data formats, but doesn’t deliver continuity — mappings and exceptions still depend on specialists, cost scales per partner, business users can’t resolve issues quickly, and onboarding still takes weeks."
  
  path_custom_title: "The Custom Integration Path"
  path_custom_desc: "Build your own middleware and integrations between systems."
  path_custom_reality: "High build and maintenance costs, brittle connections, inconsistent standards, a dedicated team required, and every new partner becomes a bespoke project."
  
  path_manual_title: "The Manual Process Path"
  path_manual_desc: "Rely on phone, email, spreadsheets, and manual data entry."
  path_manual_reality: "Doesn’t scale, error-prone, no clear visibility or ownership, and recovery is entirely manual — leading to delays and disputes."

  problem_missing: "<strong>What’s missing in all of them:</strong> a system of continuity for transactions — recoverable execution, automatic retry/resume, and business-operable resolution when data is wrong."
  
  breakthrough_title: "Exchange Layer: Tefter Exchange (TX)"
  solution_highlight: "We built <strong>Tefter Exchange (TX)</strong> — a system of continuity for business transactions. It keeps execution recoverable, resumes automatically after failures, and routes data decisions to the business with full traceability."
  
  how_works_title: "How Tefter Works — Quick Overview"
  
  tx_subtitle: "Tefter Exchange (TX)"
  tx_desc: "TX is the exchange/continuity layer that keeps transactions safe through failures and mismatches."
  tx_feature_1: "<strong>Recoverable execution:</strong> pause safely, retry automatically, and resume without re-entry or duplication"
  tx_feature_2: "<strong>Business-operable fixes:</strong> when data doesn’t match, route the decision to the right role (not an IT queue) and replay the transaction"
  tx_feature_3: "<strong>Partner reality:</strong> connect via EDI, API, files, or email — without forcing a new “standard”"
  tx_feature_4: "<strong>Audit + visibility:</strong> see every transaction state, owner, and next action with traceability end-to-end"
  
  tx_example_title: "Example"
  tx_example: "An order is sent with item “Product A / case of 24,” but the customer expects code “PA-24.” TX flags the mismatch, suggests a mapping, the business owner approves, TX stores the rule, and the transaction is replayed and completes — without an IT ticket."
  tx_start_quick: "<strong>Start in minutes:</strong> register your organization, get credentials, and begin transacting. Refine mappings and ERP forwarding as you go."
  tx_edi_bridge: "<strong>EDI-friendly:</strong> TX can stabilize existing EDI flows or gradually replace legacy EDI over time — reducing IT workload while increasing operational reliability."

  e2e_recovery: "TX keeps the transaction safe, retries automatically, and only asks for business input when a mapping decision is needed."
  e2e_outcome: "The transaction resumes as soon as the partner is back online — delivery stays on schedule, without manual re-entry."

  q1: "How long does implementation take?"
  a1: "You can start transacting in minutes: register your organization, get credentials, and begin receiving/sending transactions. Connecting forwarding to your ERP and refining mappings typically takes hours (sometimes days) depending on how custom the partner formats and data rules are."
  q2: "Can Tefter work alongside our existing EDI system?"
  a2: "Yes. Tefter can run in parallel with existing systems, allowing gradual migration or permanent coexistence depending on your needs."
  q3: "What integration formats do you support?"
  a3: "All major EDI standards (EDIFACT, X12), XML (UBL, GS1), JSON, CSV, email, and custom formats. If you can parse it, Tefter can process it."
  q4: "Is training required for business users?"
  a4: "Basic training takes 1-2 hours. The interface is designed for business users, not technical experts. Most users are productive immediately."
  q5: "What about security and compliance?"
  a5: "Enterprise-grade security built in. GDPR-compliant, hosted in EU (Brussels). SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 in progress. Full details on our"
