### WHAT IS BUSINESS OPERATIONS INTEGRATION?

**Headline:**
A New Category: Business Operations Integration

**Introduction:**
Traditional EDI connects systems. Traditional ERP runs business processes. Tefter bridges both worlds — it's a platform that operates your business AND ensures data flows reliably across your entire ecosystem, even when partners change formats, networks fail, or data doesn't match.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Most companies face a choice:
1. Use their ERP for operations but struggle with partner integrations (manual EDI mapping, IT dependency, weeks to onboard suppliers)
2. Build custom integrations but lack operational apps for field teams
3. Accept operational delays and data errors as "the cost of doing business"

**Tefter's Approach:**
We created **Business Operations Integration** — where operational apps (for your teams) and exchange infrastructure (for your data) work as one system. Business users manage both operations AND fix integration errors without waiting for IT.

**Designer Instructions:**
- Create a three-column comparison visual:
  - Column 1: "Traditional EDI" (complex technical diagram, IT-dependent)
  - Column 2: "Traditional ERP" (operations only, manual partner management)
  - Column 3: "Tefter" (unified operations + exchange with business user in control)
- Use icons to show: speed, user empowerment, reliability
- Consider a side-by-side timeline: "Old way: 6 weeks to onboard partner" vs "Tefter: Same day"

### HOW TEFTER WORKS — QUICK OVERVIEW

**Exchange Layer (TX) — The Backbone**

Resilient, format-agnostic data exchange that never stops:
- Supports EDI, XML, JSON, CSV, and custom formats
- Automatic retries and error handling when systems fail
- AI-assisted mapping when data doesn't match
- Business users resolve mapping errors without IT intervention

**Example:** Your field rep submits an order for "Coca-Cola 500ml 24-pack" but your customer's system expects SKU "CC500-24". TX detects the mismatch, AI suggests the mapping, your sales manager approves with one click, and the order processes immediately.

**Operational Layer — Where Work Happens**

Five integrated modules for daily operations:
1. **Sales:** Field reps enter orders from mobile → real-time sync to customer ERP via TX
2. **Procurement:** Create purchase orders → suppliers receive via TX or email
3. **Warehouse:** Manage picking, packing, shipping → inventory updates propagate automatically
4. **Partner Management:** Onboard suppliers/customers, define rules, manage mappings — no IT required
5. **Shipping Optimization:** Optimize delivery routes, reduce costs, improve schedules

**Business Outcomes:**
- Orders, invoices, and shipments flow without interruption — even during failures
- Reduced manual escalations and operational downtime
- Partner onboarding: from 6 weeks → same day
- Business teams fix data errors in minutes, not days

**CTA:**
→ See all modules in detail

### KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

**1. Business-Operable Platform**

**What This Means:**
Your business teams (sales, procurement, warehouse, logistics) operate independently without constant IT involvement. IT sets up the platform once; business users manage daily operations, partner onboarding, error resolution, and rule changes.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Sales rep submits order on paper
- Office staff enters order into system (hours later)
- Order fails due to SKU mismatch
- IT support ticket created
- IT fixes mapping (days later)
- Order finally processed

**Tefter Approach:**
- Sales rep enters order on mobile (instant)
- SKU mismatch detected immediately
- AI suggests mapping
- Sales manager approves on mobile (seconds)
- Order processed immediately

**Outcome:** IT offload, business agility, faster operations

---

**2. Unified Operations + Exchange**

**What This Means:**
You don't need one system for operations (orders, warehouse, shipping) and another for integrations (EDI, API, partners). Tefter is both.

**Traditional Approach:**
- ERP for operations (complex, expensive)
- EDI provider for partner integrations (rigid, IT-dependent)
- Custom middleware to connect them (maintenance burden)
- Multiple vendor relationships and contracts
- Integration points that break frequently

**Tefter Approach:**
- One platform for both operations and exchange
- Operational apps connected to TX backbone automatically
- Single vendor, single contract, single support relationship
- Built-in integration eliminates middleware complexity

**Outcome:** Lower total cost of ownership, simpler architecture, fewer vendor dependencies

---

**3. Fast Partner Ecosystem Expansion**

**What This Means:**
Your ability to grow is not limited by integration complexity. Add new suppliers, customers, and partners in hours, not weeks.

**Business Impact:**
- Launch into new markets quickly
- Test new suppliers without commitment
- Respond to opportunities rapidly
- Scale operations without scaling IT team

**Real-World Example:**
FMCG manufacturer wants to launch seasonal promotion:
- Traditional: 6 weeks to onboard 5 new suppliers (misses seasonal window)
- Tefter: 5 suppliers live in one business day (launches on schedule)

---

**4. Enterprise Reliability with Business Flexibility**

**What This Means:**
You get the robustness and security of enterprise systems with the agility of business-user control.

**Enterprise Grade:**
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Multi-zone redundancy
- Automatic failover
- Encrypted data
- Audit trails
- Compliance-ready

**Business Flexibility:**
- Business users manage partner mappings
- Sales managers approve order changes
- Procurement teams adjust supplier rules
- No IT bottleneck for routine changes

**Outcome:** Reliable operations without sacrificing speed

---

**5. Format-Agnostic Integration**

**What This Means:**
Connect to any partner regardless of their technical capabilities. Support EDI-capable enterprises and email-only small suppliers with the same platform.

**Supported Formats:**
- EDI (X12, EDIFACT, VDA)
- XML (UBL, GS1, custom schemas)
- JSON (RESTful APIs)
- CSV (spreadsheet interchange)
- Email (PDF attachments)
- Custom protocols via configuration

**Business Value:**
Don't force partners to change their systems. Meet them where they are.

### Tone of Voice

**Overall Tone:**
- Professional but accessible
- Confident but not arrogant
- Technical when needed, business-focused by default
- Problem-solving oriented
- Empathetic to customer pain points

**For CIOs (Technical Audience):**

### Content Principles

1. **Lead with Pain Points:** Start with the problem, then show Tefter as solution
2. **Show, Don't Tell:** Use scenarios and examples rather than abstract claims
3. **Quantify When Possible:** Use specific metrics (even if projected)
4. **Use Comparisons:** "Traditional way vs Tefter way" helps understanding
5. **Focus on Outcomes:** Not just features, but business impact
6. **Be Specific:** "6 weeks to 4 hours" is better than "much faster"
7. **Use Real Scenarios:** FMCG examples, warehouse workflows, field sales stories
8. **Maintain Credibility:** Mark projections as projections, be honest about roadmap items

### Call-to-Action Strategy

**Primary CTA:** "Book a demo" (emphasize throughout site)
**Secondary CTAs:** "See product overview", "Explore apps", "Read documentation"

**CTA Placement:**
- Hero section (above fold)
- End of each major section
- Floating CTA bar (optional)
- Footer

**CTA Design:**
- High contrast (stands out from page)
- Clear, action-oriented text
- Size: Large enough to be prominent but not overwhelming
- Hover states to indicate interactivity
